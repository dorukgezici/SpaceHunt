# Definition of Done

**Done** task have to meet the following points:

- Produced code for presumed functionalities
- Assumptions of User Story/task met
- Project builds without errors
- Any configuration or build change documented
- Every team member agrees User Story/task is done
- No team member would change anything

In every Sprint planning meeting our team together defines tasks for each User Story in Sprint backlock.
The tasks are then distributed between members of the team. Only the team member who has responsibility
for the task, can change it's status. If the owner of the task thinks that the task is done,
he/she will mark it as **ready**.

As soon as everybody see the task and agree, that it is done, we can mark it as **done**. 
This is discussed either through skype or at the meetings. Again only the owner of the task can mark it as **done**.
When every tasks in User Story are marked as **done**,
whole User Story can be marked as **done** and whoever from the team can do it.
